--CONCLUSION OF ANALYSIS 1
--1. Compare the overall average fare per trip for November and December.
--November - 13.06, December - 12.85

--2. Explore the â€˜number of passengers per tripâ€™ - how many trips are made by each level of â€˜Passenger_countâ€™? Do most people travel solo or with other people?
--Most people prefer to travel solo
--Number of passengers        number of trips
--	1                              821261

--3. Which is the most preferred mode of payment?
--Credit card is the most preferred type of payment

--4. What is the average tip paid per trip? Compare the average tip with the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and comment whether the â€˜average tipâ€™ is a representative statistic (of the central tendency) of â€˜tip amount paidâ€™.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--CONCLUSION- ANALYSIS 2
--1.What is the correlation between the number of passengers on any given trip, and the tip paid per trip? Do multiple travellers tip more compared to solo travellers? Hint: Use CORR(Col_1, Col_2)
-- There is no strong correlation between number of passengers and the tip paid as it is -0.049.
--Solo travellers pay more tip than group travellers. The average tip for solo travellers is 1.934 and for group travellers is 0.784.


--2.Segregate the data into five segments of â€˜tip paidâ€™: [0-5), [5-10), [10-15) , [15-20) and >=20. Calculate the percentage share of each bucket (i.e. the fraction of trips falling in each bucket).
--tip_group	         percent_of_total

--10-15	             1.85%

--5-10	             5.66%
--Above 20	         0.09%


--3.Which month has a greater average â€˜speedâ€™ - November or December? Note that the variable â€˜speedâ€™ will have to be derived from other metrics. Hint: You have columns for distance and time.
--avg_speed_nov	  avg_speed_dec
--10.998	      11.095
--December has more average speed than November


--4.Analyse the average speed of the most happening days of the year, i.e. 31st December (New yearâ€™s eve) and 25th December (Christmas) and compare it with the overall average. 
--Overall average speed is 11.05 mph, Average speed on Christmas is 15.27 mph, Average speed on New year eve is 13.24 mph.
--The average speed on Christmas and New year eve is higher than the overall average speed, but its highest on Christmas.
